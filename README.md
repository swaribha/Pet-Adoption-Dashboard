In this project, we scraped Adoptapet.com and gathered data on cats and dogs available for adoption for visualization. The web scraping was performed using Python, Beautiful Soup, and Splinter. The data is then stored in a MongoDB database. Libraries used for generating the following visualizations include D3.js, Leaflet.JS, Plotly.JS, and Chart.JS.

The visualization dashboard can be found here: https://pet-adoption-dashboard.herokuapp.com
The current data set was collected on June 16, 2019. It contains information on 520 cats and 520 dogs within 50 miles of Chicago, IL.
